### Personal Statement

I remember my first day at college so vividly, like pages in a book that edges and yellows with time but never fades in clarity. Stepping into this new world, I carried not just my belongings but also the weight of my identity—an Asian male, with a mix of excitement and trepidation, bracing myself for the stories that awaited.

Growing up in a predominantly Asian community, my cultural roots were a source of strength and pride. From celebrating Lunar New Year with firecrackers and red lanterns, eating mooncakes during Mid-Autumn Festival, to respecting the harmony of balance in everyday life, my identity was profoundly etched by my heritage. However, venturing into a diverse college campus stirred a complex blend of emotions that demanded I navigate and redefine this identity within a broader societal context.

In one of our initial group projects, I was assigned to a team with peers from diverse backgrounds. While I excelled in the technical aspects of the project, an unexpected challenge emerged. My classmates primarily saw me through a lens of common stereotypes—hardworking, quiet, and good at math. While partially accurate, these assumptions overshadowed other crucial facets of my personality. The struggle was not about bending to fit these stereotypes, but about breaking out of them and showing that I was more multidimensional—an avid debater, a passionate writer, an aspiring leader.

The most pivotal experience came during a heated debate in our World Politics class. I fervently voiced my opinion on global trade policies, drawing from historical references and contemporary data, only to be met with surprise from my classmates. Later, a fellow student confessed she hadn't expected me to be so outspoken. In that moment, I realized the strength in defying expectations and the importance of forging my own narrative.

Yet, the journey was not just about overcoming stereotypes; it was also about finding community and contributing uniquely. I joined the Asian Student Association (ASA) not just as a passive member but as an active participant and eventually, a leader. We organized cultural events, from Dim Sum tasting sessions to panels discussing the model minority myth. But we also collaborated with other cultural associations, finding common ground and celebrating diversity beyond our own. This leadership role enabled me to blend my cultural pride with a broader cultural competence, educating and learning in unison.

Struggles were present beyond cultural identity. As a first-generation college student, the labyrinth of scholarships, internships, and academic expectations was daunting. However, this challenge honed my problem-solving abilities and resilience. Guiding my younger sister through her college applications solidified my role as a mentor within my family and community. The sense of fulfillment and responsibility was profound.

Academically, integrating my passion for technology with my desire to make a societal impact led me to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). My sophomore internship at a startup focused on assistive technology for the elderly, especially those from minority backgrounds. There, I understood how technical skills could intersect with cultural empathy, driving innovation that speaks to universal and inclusive design. That summer was transformative, rekindling my drive and shaping my professional aspirations to merge tech with social good.

Reflecting on my journey, college has not merely been an academic sojourn but a transformative life experience. It has been about untangling layers of identity, challenging stereotypes, embracing leadership, and resonating with cultural empathy. As I journey forward, I am committed to pushing boundaries and fostering inclusivity, armed with the knowledge that identity is not a constraint but a catalyst for growth and change.

I stand now at the cusp of another transition, ready to bring more than the sum of my experiences into a new academic environment. I look forward to contributing richly and learning diversely, ever conscious of my heritage, and emboldened by the path I’ve forged. The tapestry of my identity, woven through threads of culture, resilience, and ambition, is one I proudly unfurl as I take this next step in my journey.

**Personal Statement**

As I stood in the long line to receive my dorm key on the first day of college, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. It was a mixture not unlike what I felt during my first trip to America years ago. Growing up as an immigrant in a small town, I often found myself balancing two identities: the traditions of my Asian heritage and the fast-paced, ever-changing American lifestyle. Today, as I embark on my journey in higher education, I am ready to delve deeper into this duality and emerge stronger, more understanding, and more integrated.

Navigating college as an Asian male, I quickly noticed both subtle and overt challenges. On one hand, I faced the ubiquitous “model minority” stereotype, which assumed I was naturally proficient in mathematics and science. Comments like “You must be great at calculus!" greeted me more often than my own name in some of my introductory classes. While finding myself capable in these subjects, such assumptions diminished the hard work and effort I put into my studies. They failed to recognize my passion for other pursuits such as creative writing and music, casting a shadow over the multifaceted nature of my identity.

One significant experience that underscored these themes happened during my freshman year when I decided to join the college debate team. As one of the few Asian members, I was deeply passionate about engaging in challenging discussions and expanding my rhetorical skills. In one particular debate, the topic of affirmative action and diversity in higher education came up. It was here where I felt my identity clash with the expectations held against me. A fellow debater confidently declared that I was ‘fortunate’ to benefit from both sides: the supposed advantage in academics and the diversity quota for underrepresented races.

This moment seared into my mind, leaving me with a complex whirlpool of emotions. Rather than retreating inward, however, I saw this as an opportunity for growth. I took the initiative to host a series of open dialogues on campus called "Breaking Stereotypes," where students of all backgrounds could discuss and dismantle preconceived notions about race, ethnicity, and identity. We shared personal stories, including my own struggles with my multiracial identity and the assumptions that came with it. These conversations helped humanize the abstract labels we often unconsciously place on each other and gave me a profound appreciation for the power of empathy and open-mindedness.

Simultaneously, I was involved in cultural organizations that celebrated my Asian heritage. In these communities, I found a sense of belonging and pride. I connected with peers through traditional festivals, martial arts, and cooking sessions. More importantly, these spaces allowed me to explore the richness of my cultural roots without feeling alienated or exoticized. I learned to navigate and cherish the dual aspects of my identity, solidifying my understanding that I need not choose one over the other, but rather, I could embrace my whole self.

As I prepare for the next chapter of my academic journey, I reflect on how these experiences have honed my resilience, adaptability, and leadership. They have also fueled my zeal to contribute to a community that values diversity not just as a buzzword, but as an essential fabric of society. I envision fostering an inclusive environment where stories like mine, and those of countless others, can thrive and inspire. 

In the classroom, I will bring my perspective as an analytical thinker and a passionate advocate for equity. Outside of it, I will continue to be a bridge-builder, creating spaces where all students can feel seen, heard, and valued. My college journey is still unfolding, and I am eager to contribute my voice, my passion, and my varied experiences to make it a richer, more understanding place for all.

Personal Statement

As I walked through the towering gates of Franklin University, I felt a swirl of emotions—excitement, uncertainty, and a hope tinged with nervous anticipation. Little did I know that my college journey would be a tapestry woven with the threads of self-discovery, learning, and embracing the vast spectrum of human experiences.

Growing up in a small, homogeneous town, my interactions were largely confined to people who looked like me and shared similar backgrounds. Although I always knew there was more to the world, college promised to be the pivotal point where I would step out of my comfort zone. Franklin University, with its diverse student body and robust academic offerings, was the perfect setting for this transformative journey.

My first real encounter with diversity came during orientation. I was assigned to a suite with three other girls from various corners of the globe. Maria, with her rich Mexican heritage; Aisha, whose parents hailed from Nigeria; and Mei, whose family had emigrated from China. At first, our suite's cultural differences seemed daunting. I worried whether my experiences and upbringing would pale in comparison or if I would unintentionally offend someone.

One night as we sat around sharing stories and laughter, I realized how much I had to learn from my suite-mates and they from me. We bonded over late-night study sessions, shared meals of cultural dishes, and opened our hearts and minds to each other's backgrounds. From Maria, I learned about the significance of Dia de Los Muertos and how honoring ancestors strengthens family bonds. Aisha introduced me to the vibrant world of Afrobeat music and the resilience embedded in Nigerian folklore. Mei’s tales of Chinese New Year celebrations and the profound importance of family unity offered me an entirely new perspective on tradition. Our suite became a microcosm of the world, teaching us acceptance, empathy, and the beauty of shared human experiences.

Another significant experience during my college years was joining the Debate Team. This activity honed my critical thinking and public speaking skills, but more importantly, it exposed me to a myriad of viewpoints. One heated debate on immigration policies reshaped my understanding. My initial stance was heavily influenced by the limited perspectives I had grown up around. Through rigorous research and engaging with my teammates' diverse viewpoints, I learned the complexities of immigration issues and the importance of human dignity and compassion in policy-making. It was a humbling experience, realizing that to form a well-rounded opinion, one must consider stories and struggles different from their own.

My academic journey was equally transformative. Majoring in Environmental Science, I joined a research project on sustainable farming practices. Our team comprised individuals from different socio-economic backgrounds and regions. Collaborating with them taught me that environmental issues, while global, have profoundly local impacts. A rural farmer's challenges in Nebraska are starkly different from those of a fisherwoman in Bangladesh. This realization deepened my commitment to seeking inclusive and equitable solutions in my future career.

Beyond academics and cultural learning, college life taught me resilience. As someone who had always been an overachiever, I faced my first academic setback during my sophomore year. A particularly challenging course in Advanced Chemistry seemed insurmountable. The sting of receiving my first failing grade was harsh, but it was through this failure that I discovered the importance of perseverance and seeking help. My professor, a brilliant and compassionate woman, mentored me, teaching me not just the subject matter but also the value of grit and determination.

In summary, my college experience at Franklin University was a period of profound growth and learning. Navigating through cultural diversity, academic challenges, and self-discovery has shaped me into a more empathetic, resilient, and open-minded individual. As I stand on the threshold of the next chapter in my academic journey, I carry with me the lessons learned and the stories shared, ready to contribute to and learn from the rich tapestry of human experience that awaits.

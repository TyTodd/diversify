### Personal Statement

Growing up in a predominantly white suburban town, I lived a relatively sheltered and homogeneous life. Diversity, equity, and inclusion were terms I heard but never fully grasped until I stepped onto the vibrant, multicultural campus of State University. My freshman year became a turning point, challenging and transforming my outlook on the world in profound ways.

The shift hit me early on during my freshman seminar, aptly titled "Society and Identity." It was a diverse class with students from all walks of life. Reflecting back, I'll never forget the first time I heard people share their stories during a heated discussion about race and privilege. My peer Sarah, an African American woman in my seminar, spoke passionately about the microaggressions she faced daily. Mark, an international student from China, shared his struggles with cultural misunderstandings. These narratives were eye-opening and left me feeling both ignorant and responsible.

Growing up, I believed in the ideal of meritocracy – the notion that hard work and determination could overcome all obstacles. My family and I often discussed our immigrant ancestors, painting ourselves as paragons of this ideal. It wasn't until these seminar discussions that I began to see the broader picture and recognize the layers of systemic inequality that benefitted me without my awareness.

Determined to educate myself and engage more deeply, I joined the campus chapter of Students for Social Justice. I wanted to learn from others and understand the complex layers of privilege and oppression that I hadn’t been exposed to before. It was a challenging but necessary journey. I listened more than I spoke, digesting stories of hardship and perseverance that veiled the reality of systemic inequities my friends and peers faced.

One of the most impactful experiences was participating in a cultural immersion project. Our group was tasked with living on a minimal budget for a week, mimicking the financial constraints many college students endure daily. The project was a sobering lesson in awareness and resourcefulness. I found myself choosing between buying a textbook and a meal, a dilemma I'd never previously encountered. This experience taught me empathy, not just as a concept but as a lived reality. It drove home the message that my day-to-day struggles were different from those faced by so many others, simply because of the privileges I'd taken for granted.

Academically, I sought courses that would broaden my understanding further. Taking classes in African American history, gender studies, and global politics opened my eyes to the richness and complexity of human experiences. It inspired me to question the narratives I had previously accepted uncritically and to embrace a more nuanced understanding of the world.

These experiences culminated in a newfound commitment to allyship. I took on leadership roles within Students for Social Justice, facilitated workshops, and even helped organize events like the annual Diversity Week. I became a part of my university’s inclusivity advisory board, working with administrators to implement policies and programs aimed at fostering an inclusive campus environment. My role wasn’t to lead the charge but to support and amplify the voices that needed to be heard. 

As I prepare for the next chapter in my academic journey, I carry with me a deep appreciation for diversity and an unwavering commitment to equity. My experiences at State University have shaped me into someone who not only acknowledges my privilege but actively seeks to use it for positive change. I have learned that real growth stems from discomfort, and that being an ally means continuously learning, listening, and working to dismantle the systems of inequality that persist in our society.

In my future academic and professional endeavors, I am committed to fostering environments where every individual feels seen, valued, and empowered. College has transformed me from a passive bystander into an active participant in the journey toward a more just and inclusive world. I am excited to bring this perspective, dedication, and willingness to learn to the next stage of my education and beyond.

When I look back on the past three years of my life, the summer of my sophomore year stands out as a transformative period, one that reshaped my understanding of leadership, diversity, and personal growth. As a white male growing up in a predominantly homogeneous community, my perspectives on race, privilege, and social dynamics were shaped largely by second-hand experiences and academic readings. However, it wasn’t until I volunteered with the Youth Leadership Program—a summer program aimed at fostering community engagement among a diverse group of high school students—that I truly began to understand the complexity and importance of these issues.

The program grouped together students from various backgrounds, ethnicities, and life experiences, many of which were unfamiliar to me. We engaged in team-building exercises, community service projects, and open forums designed to encourage honest dialogue about social justice and inequality. From the very first day, I was both excited and apprehensive, unsure of what to expect and eager to make a positive impact.

One of the most impactful moments occurred during a workshop on privilege and systemic inequality. We were tasked with an exercise called the "Privilege Walk." Participants stepped forward or backward based on their answers to certain questions related to their upbringing. As the questions progressed, I found myself consistently moving forward, while many of my peers moved backward. By the end of the exercise, I was standing near the front, quite alone, while others were far behind. It was a powerful visual representation of the unearned advantages I had unknowingly benefited from my entire life.

Our group then engaged in a candid discussion about the exercise, sharing our feelings and reflections. Hearing my peers' stories of overcoming obstacles that I had never had to face was humbling. One student, Ana, recounted her daily struggles balancing schoolwork with a part-time job to support her family, while another, Malik, spoke about the challenges and fears he faced growing up as a young Black man in America. These conversations were eye-opening and led me to realize that my perspective was just one of many, and that there was so much more I needed to learn about the experiences of others.

This revelation was not just limited to recognizing privilege, but also understanding the importance of allyship. I realized that being an ally wasn’t about feeling guilty for my privileges, but about using them responsibly to support and uplift others. It was about listening, learning, and actively participating in efforts to create a more equitable society.

Inspired by this newfound understanding, I decided to take concrete steps in my own school. I joined the Diversity Club and started a mentorship program pairing seniors with freshmen from underrepresented groups to help them navigate high school challenges. I also worked with our administration to organize a series of workshops and speaker events focused on social justice issues. These initiatives not only enriched my peers' high school experience but also broadened my own education, allowing me to build meaningful relationships across different cultural and social backgrounds.

As I prepare to transition to college, I carry with me the lessons from the Youth Leadership Program. I am committed to continuing my journey of growth, understanding, and advocacy. I aim to be an active member of any community I join, contributing positively and helping foster an environment of inclusivity and respect. My experiences have taught me that acknowledging my privilege and using it constructively to assist others is a lifelong endeavor.

In college, I look forward to engaging with diverse groups, participating in service-oriented organizations, and continuing my education on issues of social justice. I am eager to embrace opportunities that challenge my perspectives, expand my understanding, and enable me to become a more empathetic and effective leader.

Ultimately, I believe that my experiences have prepared me to contribute meaningfully to your institution and to grow both personally and academically. I am excited about the potential to further develop these values and to embark on this new chapter with a commitment to making a positive impact.

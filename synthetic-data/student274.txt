**Personal Statement**

Growing up in a small Midwestern town, my world was tightly knit and homogenous, offering few opportunities to interact with people from diverse backgrounds. My high school was the epitome of familiarity; I knew almost everyone by name, and they knew me. This upbringing might seem limiting to some, but it cultivated within me a yearning to explore, learn, and connect beyond the borders of my immediate environment. This craving for diverse perspectives took a pivotal turn during my summer internship after my junior year of high school, an experience that significantly shaped my ambitions and outlook.

I was fortunate to secure an internship with a tech company in a vibrant, culturally-rich city. Eager and somewhat nervous, I left my familiar surroundings behind, stepping into a world bursting with diversity and new experiences. My team was a melting pot of ethnicities, ages, and cultures, with everyone bringing their unique perspectives to the table. It was here that I first confronted the reality of my own privilege and the importance of empathy and openness.

My initial days were filled with a mix of awe and discomfort. My upbringing had not equipped me with the cultural literacy that seemed second nature to many of my colleagues. During lunch breaks, conversations would traverse global issues, cultural anecdotes, and life stories that felt worlds apart from my own experiences. It was humbling to realize how much I had yet to learn. Rather than retreating into my shell, I chose to embrace this discomfort as an opportunity to grow.

One of the most impactful experiences during this internship was participating in a company-sponsored hackathon designed to address social issues through technology. Our team was tasked with creating an app to help recent immigrants navigate the complexities of settling in a new country. Working on this project opened my eyes to the challenges many people face, challenges that had never been part of my reality. Collaborating with team members from diverse backgrounds offered insights that were crucial for the appâ€™s development and profoundly influenced my perspective.

Jane, a software engineer originally from Nigeria, shared her personal experiences of moving to the U.S. Her stories of cultural adaptation, the struggle to find community, and the bureaucratic hurdles she faced were eye-opening. Listening to Jane and others, I began to understand the invisible barriers that exist, often unnoticed by someone like myself. Their resilience and determination were inspiring, and their stories fueled my commitment to making our project as impactful as possible.

This journey was not just about developing an app; it was about fostering an environment where empathy and understanding could thrive. I focused on bridging the gap between different perspectives within our team, ensuring that every voice was heard and valued. Through this experience, I learned the importance of active listening and the power of diverse viewpoints in driving innovation and social change.

The hackathon concluded with our team winning first place, but the true victory for me was the personal transformation I underwent. I returned home with a newfound appreciation for diversity and a commitment to fostering inclusivity in every aspect of my life. This experience ignited a passion for social justice and technology's potential to effect positive change, guiding my aspirations as I look towards college and beyond.

In college, I am eager to immerse myself in an environment rich with diverse perspectives, where I can continue to learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully. I am particularly interested in programs that emphasize social impact and interdisciplinary collaboration, as I believe these areas are crucial for addressing the complex challenges of our time. My goal is to leverage my skills and experiences to create innovative solutions that promote equity and inclusivity, contributing to a world where everyone, regardless of background, has the opportunity to thrive.

The journey from my small town to the bustling diversity of my internship was transformative, shaping not just my aspirations but my very understanding of the world. I am excited to bring this spirit of curiosity, empathy, and determination to my college experience, eagerly anticipating the opportunities to learn, grow, and make a difference.

Growing up as a first-generation Asian-American, I've always stood with one foot in two different worlds. My parents, who immigrated from South Korea, instilled in me the values of hard work, respect for tradition, and the importance of family. However, as I navigate my identity in a predominantly non-Asian community, I've also learned to embrace the diverse tapestry of cultures that define the American experience.

Starting college was both exhilarating and daunting. I knew that it would be a journey of self-discovery and growth, but I underestimated the challenges that would come with balancing cultural expectations with my personal goals. My parents had dreams of me becoming a doctor, a path that many of my Asian peers seemed to follow. While I respect the medical field immensely, my passion lies in environmental science, a field I believe is crucial for the future of our planet.

Breaking this news to my family was no easy feat. I vividly remember the day I sat down with my parents, heart pounding, and explained my aspirations. Their initial reaction was one of disappointment, which stung deeply. Yet, it was also a moment of understanding and compromise. They wanted the best for me, and I had to prove that following my passion could also lead to a successful and fulfilling career.

In college, I encountered stereotypes and biases that I hadnâ€™t fully experienced in high school. There were moments when classmates assumed I was naturally good at math or science simply because I was Asian. These assumptions were not only frustrating but also minimized the hard work and effort I put into my studies. However, these experiences pushed me to excel and break these stereotypes, proving that my achievements were a result of diligence and dedication.

Finding a sense of belonging was another challenge. My university was diverse, yet I often felt like I was floating between different social circles. Joining the Asian Student Association became a turning point. It was a space where I could connect with peers who shared similar cultural experiences and challenges. Through this organization, I not only found camaraderie but also took on leadership roles, orchestrating cultural events and discussions that celebrated our heritage while educating others.

One of our most impactful initiatives was "Culture Night," where we showcased traditional music, dance, and cuisine from various Asian cultures. It was heartwarming to see the broader campus community engage with and appreciate our traditions. This event also served as a reminder of the rich cultural legacy I carried and the importance of sharing it with pride.

Despite my positive experiences, there were moments of hardship. I faced subtle forms of racism and microaggressions, which took a toll on my mental health. There was an incident in my sophomore year when a group project led to a peer openly questioning my English proficiency, despite it being my first language. Situations like these were isolating, but they also made me resilient. With the support of friends and campus resources, I learned to confront these issues head-on and advocate for myself.

Language barriers were another hurdle. Although I was fluent in English, my parents were not. Explaining academic concepts or translating official documents for them was a frequent task. This responsibility reinforced the intergenerational gap, but it also strengthened our bond, as I became a bridge between their world and mine.

Amidst these experiences, I made it a priority to manage my mental health and well-being. College can be overwhelming, but I found solace in activities like meditation, yoga, and seeking counsel from mental health professionals when needed. It was essential to me to balance academic rigor with self-care, ensuring I could thrive in both realms.

My journey as an Asian female in college has been multifaceted, filled with moments of challenge and triumph. It has taught me the importance of resilience, the value of cultural heritage, and the power of advocacy. As I look forward to the next chapter of my life, I carry with me the lessons learned, ready to embrace new opportunities and continue breaking barriers.

As I prepared to leave for college, I was filled with a mixture of excitement and apprehension. Born to first-generation Chinese immigrants, my upbringing had been a delicate balance of honoring tradition while navigating the American culture I was immersed in. Entering a world where I would be living away from my family for the first time, I knew I would face a series of challenges and opportunities that would shape who I am.

One of the most significant experiences in my college life was joining the Asian Students Association (ASA). I was first drawn to ASA not only because it offered a sense of community, but also because it was a platform for advocacy and cultural exchange. During my freshman year, I took part in organizing an Asian Heritage Week. This included a series of events such as cultural performances, workshops, and discussions addressing various aspects of Asian identity in America. I remember vividly the panel discussion on "Breaking Stereotypes and Embracing Individuality." This event opened my eyes to the many facets of cultural identity and the pervasive stereotypes that still exist.

Throughout the event, students shared their personal stories of feeling pigeonholedâ€”portrayed by stereotypes as either the "model minority" or eternally foreign. Hearing these stories motivated me to reflect on my own experiences. I recalled instances when I was presumed to be a math whiz just because of my ethnicity, or times when my peers assumed my parents owned a Chinese restaurant. These misconceptions, while seemingly benign, were a personal affront to my individuality and humanity.

The pressure to conform to the "model minority" stereotype also took a toll on my mental health. My family had high expectations for my academic performance, often reminding me of the sacrifices they made to provide me with opportunities they never had. While I shared their desire for success, the constant pressure sometimes led to overwhelming anxiety. I found solace in the friendships I made through ASA, where we openly discussed these pressures and supported one another through mindful practices, such as meditation sessions and wellness retreats organized by the association.

Another cornerstone of my college journey was my foray into the world of STEM. As a Computer Science major, I quickly realized that women, particularly Asian women, were underrepresented in this field. I decided to join Women in Technology (WiT), a student-led organization that sought to empower women in STEM. In WiT, I found mentors who guided me through coursework, internship applications, and professional development. One mentor, in particular, was an alumna who worked at a leading tech company. She shared with me her experiences navigating a male-dominated industry while staying true to her cultural roots. Her story inspired me to persevere and reminded me that my unique perspective as an Asian woman was not a hindrance, but an asset.

Moreover, I had the opportunity to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration, the world's largest gathering of women technologists. It was an empowering experience that not only connected me with role models but also exposed me to a plethora of opportunities in the tech industry. The sense of camaraderie and mutual encouragement at the conference reinforced my commitment to break barriers and contribute to a more inclusive tech community.

In summary, my college experience as an Asian female has been a journey of self-discovery, resilience, and advocacy. I have learned to navigate and challenge cultural stereotypes, balance familial expectations with personal aspirations, and actively engage in creating supportive communities. Pursuing a career in technology while honoring my cultural heritage, I aspire to be a role model and advocate for diversity and inclusion. 

College has transformed me into a more confident, empathetic, and determined individual. Looking ahead, I am eager to continue this journey of growth and contribute meaningfully to my field and society as a whole.

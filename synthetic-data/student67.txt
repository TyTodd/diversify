Stepping onto the campus of my dream university, I was overwhelmed by a whirlwind of emotions—excitement, a hint of anxiety, but mostly an unbridled sense of possibility. The sun was setting over the iconic clock tower, casting long shadows on the verdant quadrangle. As I navigated my way through numerous student groups and activities, I couldn't help but reflect on my journey to this moment and how my cultural identity as an Asian female shaped it.

Growing up in a traditionally-minded household in San Francisco, education was always emphasized as the key to success. My parents, immigrants from Taiwan, worked tirelessly to provide my siblings and me with opportunities they could only dream of. My early years were marked by balancing two worlds: adhering to the values and traditions of my heritage while striving to excel in the American educational system. This double consciousness, although sometimes challenging, has been an invaluable facet of my identity.

My passion for environmental engineering was ignited during a heritage trip to Taiwan. While there, I witnessed firsthand the stark environmental challenges faced by many urban areas, from air pollution to water scarcity. These issues struck a chord in me, as I saw the direct impact on the lives of people, particularly marginalized communities. I vowed to become a force of change, leveraging my education to develop sustainable solutions.

However, navigating the path to my chosen field was not devoid of obstacles. As an Asian female interested in STEM, I sometimes found myself as the only representative of my gender and ethnicity in advanced classes. This reality was daunting and often felt isolating, but it also fueled a determination to break stereotypes. Joining the Robotics Club in high school, I not only worked on innovative projects but also mentored younger girls, encouraging them to pursue their passions in science and technology. It was gratifying to spark enthusiasm and confidence in others, mirroring the support I received from pioneering women in STEM who inspired me.

Throughout my high school career, balancing familial expectations with personal ambitions was a constant juggle. As my parents hoped for me to follow a “safer” route in medicine or law, I respectfully navigated these conversations, demonstrating through my achievements and unyielding passion that environmental engineering was my calling. Their eventual support, borne out of understanding and faith in my vision, reinforced the importance of communication and perseverance.

Upon arriving at university, the rich diversity of the student body was both a comfort and a revelation. Here, I found solace in meeting peers who shared similar backgrounds and experiences, allowing me to embrace my cultural identity fully. Yet, the true growth came from engaging with those from different walks of life. The university environment fostered a unique blend of collaboration and challenge, prompting profound personal and intellectual growth.

In my freshman year, joining the Asian American Student Association (AASA) and the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) provided me with a supportive community. Through AASA, I participated in cultural events that celebrated our heritage, from Lunar New Year festivals to discussion panels addressing the “model minority” myth. These experiences were pivotal, as they strengthened my pride in my identity and provided a platform for advocacy and education.

Engaging with SWE allowed me to connect with trailblazing women who defied odds in their respective fields. These interactions were more than just inspirational; they provided real-world insights and mentorship that were crucial as I navigated coursework and research projects. One of the most transformative experiences was initiating a collaboration between SWE and local high schools to create a mentorship program for girls interested in STEM, giving back to the community that shaped my journey.

Reflecting on my college journey thus far, I am profoundly aware of the continuous balancing act between preserving my cultural heritage and pushing the boundaries of innovation. This dual narrative not only defines who I am but also drives my academic and personal endeavors. As I move forward, I aim to bridge gaps between cultural understandings and technological advancements, contributing to a world where diverse perspectives lead to sustainable solutions.

In conclusion, my experiences as an Asian female in college have honed my resilience, broadened my worldview, and fortified my commitment to leveraging my education for the greater good. With each challenge and triumph, I am more convinced of my purpose—to be a catalyst for change, embracing the strengths of my heritage while forging new paths in environmental engineering.

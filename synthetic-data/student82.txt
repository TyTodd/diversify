**Personal Statement**

There’s a Chinese proverb that says, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” My journey, though punctuated by cultural richness, familial love, and academic challenges, began in the bustling streets of Hong Kong. As an Asian female preparing to embark on the next phase of my academic journey, I carry with me not just my personal aspirations, but also the resilience and wisdom imbued by my heritage.

During my sophomore year of high school, I had the unique opportunity to participate in a cultural exchange program in the United States. As excited as I was, I quickly realized the extent of the cultural differences and the challenges that accompanied them. The first week was particularly overwhelming. My classmates were kind, but there were moments when I felt the weight of my identity more than ever before. Questions about my background, subtle stereotypes, and occasionally ignorant comments about my ethnicity made me hyper-aware of my otherness.

One significant experience etched in my memory took place during a biology class group project. We were assigned to analyze the ecological impact of urbanization in our respective regions. As we discussed ideas, I proposed examining Hong Kong’s unique blend of urban density and natural landscapes. One of my group members, rather offhandedly, remarked, “Wow, I didn’t know Hong Kong had more than just skyscrapers. Do people even live normally there?” 

In that moment, I felt a mixture of frustration and determination. Rather than reacting defensively, I saw it as an opportunity to educate and share my culture’s complexity. I talked about Hong Kong’s relentless spirit, the balance between tradition and modernity, and the close-knit communities thriving amidst the city's rapid development. By the end of our project, not only had we detailed the ecological impacts comprehensively, but my group also walked away with a deeper understanding and appreciation of a part of the world many of them knew little about.

However, this experience was not just about educating others; it was also about navigating and asserting my own identity. I learned that there’s strength in standing out and that my background was not just a facet of who I am, but a powerful element of my perspective. Rather than feeling as though I belonged to the margins, I began to take pride in my unique viewpoint.

Another deeply formative experience was joining the Asian Student Union (ASU). Through ASU, I found a supportive community that understood my experiences and shared my values. Together, we worked on initiatives promoting cultural awareness and inclusion. One of our most impactful projects was organizing an Asian Heritage Month Fair. The event was designed to be both educational and festive, featuring traditional dances, culinary demonstrations, and talks by Asian American leaders.

As one of the lead coordinators, I worked tirelessly to ensure the fair's success. This experience taught me essential skills in leadership, organization, and teamwork. More importantly, it positioned me to mentor some of the younger ASU members, guiding them through similar challenges and helping them embrace their cultural identity.

In these encounters, I’ve discovered a profound sense of responsibility: to bridge cultural gaps, foster understanding, and contribute to an inclusive academic environment. I have come to realize that my identity as an Asian female is not just about the challenges I face but also about the contributions I can make. Embracing my cultural heritage has empowered me to break stereotypes, challenge preconceptions, and embody resilience.

As I prepare to enter college, I look forward to continuing this journey of growth and exploration. I aim to delve into fields that bridge cultures, whether through international relations, sociology, or public health—domains where I can leverage my unique perspective to make a positive impact. My past experiences have equipped me with the adaptability, insight, and determination necessary to thrive in a diverse and dynamic environment.

The single step I took from Hong Kong to the world set me on this path of discovery, enlightenment, and advocacy. I am ready to take the next steps, confident that each stride will not just bring me closer to my personal goals, but also contribute to a more inclusive, understanding, and interconnected world.
